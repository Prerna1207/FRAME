<h1>NightWatch Magnifying Clock Dock for Apple Watch</h1>
Not all tech needs to come with wires and buttons. This NightWatch orb magnifies<br>
an Apple Watch’s display to effectively turn it into an alarm clock for your bedside table.<br>
 There’s a slot in the back that holds the watch’s MagSafe charger, and tapping the surface <br>of the orb 
will wake up the watch screen so you can see the time. Plus, the shape of the <br>NightWatch amplifies sound<br>
to transform your watch into an effective alarm clock.
