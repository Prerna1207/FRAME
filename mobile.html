<h1>
Samsung Galaxy Z Flip3
</h1>
<p>
This is the first foldable phone that might be worth a go. The first few iterations of foldables were marred with reliability issues and huge price tags. However at £949, <br>
this phone is likely to cost as much on contract as the latest Apple or Google devices. There’s no sacrificing on processing power or features to make the phone work at this<br>
price either: the Flip3 comes with an octa-core processor inside, plenty of RAM and a 120Hz display. Plus it’s waterproof.

Folding the phone will split the display in two, so you can, for example, sit the phone on the table to watch videos.<br>
 There’s also a small screen on the back so that you can see notifications when your phone is shut. We’d give it a few <br>
months to see if anyone reports any hardware issues with the screen, but we personally can’t wait to see what they do with<br>
 foldable tablets next…
