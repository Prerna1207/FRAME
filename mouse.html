<h1>Zephyr PRO RGB sweat-proof gaming mouse</h1>
If you’ve ever played an online game, whether that’s Fortnite, Call Of Duty or Apex Legends,<br>.
 then you’ll have experienced the sweaty palms that come with going toe-to-toe with a cocky<br>
12-year-old shouting abuse at you over the voice comms. Short of keeping a chalk dish and a chamois<br>
 cloth beside your console, there’s not a lot you could do about it… until now. This gaming mouse houses<br>
 a tiny fan that blows cool air onto your palms through its honeycomb outer shell while you play. <br>
The rest of the mouse hardware uses the latest, most accurate sensors to keep your inputs sharp as well as dry.
