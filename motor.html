<h1>DAB Motors Concept-E</h1>
As city centres start to kick out fossil-fuel burning vehicles to reduce air pollution, electric bikes increasingly <br>
look like the best commuter option for those of us who don’t want to slip into some Lycra. Plus, would you look at this<br>
 bike! The DAB Concept-E is the electric equivalent of a 125cc motorbike, which you can ride after a few hours of training<br>
 and a thorough read of the Highway Code. The bike is reported to have a range of about 112km (70 miles) and it tops out at104km/h (65mph).<br>
 Sadly, it’s just a concept right now, with no price, but this is one of a new wave of very cool looking e-bikes on the way.
