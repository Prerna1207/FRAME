<h1>LG Signature OLED R</h1>
When you turn this TV off, the display just rolls itself up, and tucks into the small speaker cabinet below. <br>
Alternatively in ‘Line View’ mode, it shrinks down to about a fifth of its height to work as a display for the<br>
 integrated sound bar. It’s an achingly cool party trick that’s made possible by OLED technology. This kind of <br>
display doesn’t require backlights – the OLED crystals generate their own light when a current is passed through <br>
them. This means they can, if manufactured in a certain way, be built into flexible screens.

We’ve seen demos of this bendable screen technology for a couple of years now, but manufacturing is still fairly<br>
 expensive and hard to perfect, which goes some way to explaining why you’ll have to cough up a house deposit to<br>
 own one of these TVs…
